# Week 4: Moving towards building interactive tools
## Week of 09/23/2024

### Reflections

I started by reflecting on my journey, on what I use in daily life, and how each object shares data and works together. There are a lot of feedback mechanisms built in the systems currently that I realized today as I noticed the interactions of digital systems in sharing data to make our lives easier. 

### Devices & tools that I use every day.

1. Smart Phone
2. Laptop
3. Smart Watch
4. Smart Speaker
5. Email
6. Calendar
7. Wallet
8. Credit Card
9. Bank Account
10. Google Meet
11. Online Shopping Applications
12. Movie Streaming & Video Streaming Services
13. Gaming Applications
14. Refrigerator
15. Smart Lights
16. GPT

### Diagrammatic Analysis

- Calendar, Gmail, and Video Conferencing are linked to each other and constantly transfer data.
- Wallet, Credit Card, and banking applications are linked to each other and constantly transfer data.
- Laptop is linked with Bluetooth or wireless speakers at home, it is also linked to wireless mouse and keyboard to transfer and receive data.
- Smart phone and smart watch are linked together to track health goals, messaging, calls and other application-oriented activities that tend to become invisible with proper feedback loops.
- Smart phones are also linked to refrigerators, smart light and thermostats to make home settings more friendly and interactive.
- Social media applications like instagram & whatsapp are linked to eachother, to learn from users data and show us advertisements on the same.

Here is a diagram to show how things relate to each other with feedbacks that they tend to transfer to each other.

### System Interaction put to action

#### This week I also attended a AI Hackathon, focused towards health with SunQ and Josh from the MDes Cohort and we ended up building a interaction system between phone call, llm's, human dispatchers, hospitals and ambulance providers.

- problem: every minute matters in an emergency scenario and response can be slowed down by manual operation and human error
- solution: an ai voice workflow to help automate triaging and response

This is the framework that helped me understand how machines interact with each other and transfer data to optimize processes.

### Speculations

I feel the world is getting more and more connected with data transfer from one application to another, all the Google applications are linked to each other. Some connect to other applications using application protocol interface, to transfer data. We are always communicating with the world using the internet and it's getting more and more every day. 

With AI playing a huge role in the current world, we will soon see a world where all these interfaces become even more invisible. The communication layer is still invisible but sooner we will see a world where the interface layer becomes invisible too.

# Week 3: Putting all skills into work #
## Week of 09/16/2024

### Reflections
I want to push myself to build a model from scratch and make use of my skillsets to build something that solves a real problem for me and has a real use case. As you know I moved to Berkeley and am setting up my room, my charging area is currently messed up with too many things moving, and too many cables, it does not look elegant at all, so I wanted to build a stand that can hold my phone and also my I watch and charge them at once.

#### Youtube Video

I also expanded my work in video editing and this video shows the overall things that I worked on.

#### Speculations

I expected everything to work fine for the first instance itself, but I had to reiterate it and learn a little more about tolerances with 3d printing.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Week 2: Exploring Rhino Grasshopper and 3D Printing this week #
## Week of 09/07/2024

Rhino seems like an interesting software to build things as it is parametric and things can be edited quite quickly because of this. I wanted to make the phone stand for my phone dimensions so that I could keep it comfortably on my study table.

Here's how it went like:

My Understanding of Parametric Modeling

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; flex-wrap: wrap;">
    <img width="50%" alt="Custom Keychain" src="assets/Rhino Modelling.png">
</div>


I tried to edit the parameters to the iPhone XR dimensions
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; flex-wrap: wrap;">
    <img width="32%" alt="Custom Keychain" src="assets/Param1.png">
    <img width="32%" alt="Custom Keychain" src="assets/Param.png">
</div>

However, it did not work at the first instant as the base thickness was limited and the CG was going outside the stability criteria, I hence had to change the angle of the phone to make it more stable.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; flex-wrap: wrap;">
    <img width="32%" alt="Custom Keychain" src="assets/Sizedifference.png">
    <img width="32%" alt="Custom Keychain" src="assets/Assemnotgood.png">
</div>

It worked, the phone was more stable and I could bake the results instantly & then I tried to replace the base with a cylinder.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; flex-wrap: wrap;">
    <img width="32%" alt="Custom Keychain" src="assets/Assemgood.png">
    <img width="32%" alt="Custom Keychain" src="assets/phonestand3dprinted.png">
     <img width="32%" alt="Custom Keychain" src="assets/Cylinderinsteadofsphere.png">
</div>

They then created a 3D file to print the output so that I could use it.

I also tried to make a model from scratch using Grasshopper, to keep things near my bed sorted.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; flex-wrap: wrap;">
    <img width="32%" alt="Custom Keychain" src="assets/TableOnRhino.png">
    <img width="32%" alt="Custom Keychain" src="assets/3DPrintingtable.png">
     <img width="32%" alt="Custom Keychain" src="assets/BoxforBed.jpeg">
</div>

It was fun to play with parameters and very quick iterations.

# Week 1: Personalizing My New Berkeley Home #
## Week of 09/05/2024

After moving to Berkeley, I moved to a new home and wanted to make it more personal space, hence this week I worked on mini projects for my study table and home.

## DIY Projects

### Cool Pencil Stand

I made a cool pencil stand to organize my writing tools and add a unique touch to my study area. This custom-made stand serves a practical purpose and reflects my style using 3D Printing.

    <img width="32%" alt="Cool Pencil Stand" src="assets/Holder Picture">

</div>


### Custom Keychain

For my new home keys, I created a custom keychain. This personalized accessory helps me easily identify my house keys and adds a bit of flair to my everyday items using 3D Printing.

    <img width="32%" alt="Custom Keychain" src="assets/keychain.jpeg">
</div>


### Cal Logo for My Table

I made a Cal Logo for my table to show my connection to my new academic community. This decorative piece proudly displays my affiliation with the University of California, Berkeley, and adds a touch of school spirit to my study space using Laser Cutting.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; flex-wrap: wrap;">
    <img width="32%" alt="Cal Logo for My Table" src="assets/cal cutting.jpeg">
    <img width="32%" alt="Cal Logo for My Table" src="assets/Cal.jpeg">

</div>

## Impact

These DIY projects have helped me transform my new living space into a more personalized environment. By adding these custom touches, I've begun to make my new Berkeley home feel more like my own.

In the future, I will try to merge technology tools to build something that can solve my problems in the quickest way possible.
