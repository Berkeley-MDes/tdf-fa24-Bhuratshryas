# Week 2: Exploring Rhino, Grasshopper and 3D Printing this week #
## Week of 09/07/2024

Rhino seems like an interesting software to build things as it is parametric and things can be edited quite quickly because of this. I wanted to make the phone stand for my phone dimensions so that I could keep it comfortably on my study table.

Here's how it went like:

My Understanding on Parametric Modeling

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; flex-wrap: wrap;">
    <img width="50%" alt="Custom Keychain" src="assets/Rhino Modelling.png">
</div>


I tried to edit the parameters to the iPhone XR dimensions
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; flex-wrap: wrap;">
    <img width="32%" alt="Custom Keychain" src="assets/Param1.png">
    <img width="32%" alt="Custom Keychain" src="assets/Param.png">
</div>

However, it did not work at the first instant as the base thickness was limited and the CG was going outside the stability criteria, I hence had to change the angle of the phone to make it more stable.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; flex-wrap: wrap;">
    <img width="32%" alt="Custom Keychain" src="assets/Sizedifference.png">
    <img width="32%" alt="Custom Keychain" src="assets/Assemnotgood.png">
</div>

It worked, the phone was more stable and I could bake the results instantly & then I tried to replace the base with a cylinder.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; flex-wrap: wrap;">
    <img width="32%" alt="Custom Keychain" src="assets/Assemgood.png">
    <img width="32%" alt="Custom Keychain" src="assets/phonestand3dprinted.png">
     <img width="32%" alt="Custom Keychain" src="assets/Cylinderinsteadofsphere.png">
</div>

They then created a 3D file to print the output so that I could use it.

I also tried to make a model from scratch using Grasshopper, to keep things near my bed sorted.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; flex-wrap: wrap;">
    <img width="32%" alt="Custom Keychain" src="assets/TableOnRhino.png">
    <img width="32%" alt="Custom Keychain" src="assets/3DPrintingtable.png">
     <img width="32%" alt="Custom Keychain" src="assets/Printingonthetable.jpeg">
</div>

It was fun to play with parameters and very quick iterations.

# Week 1: Personalizing My New Berkeley Home #
## Week of 09/05/2024

After moving to Berkeley, I moved to a new home and wanted to make it more personal space, hence this week I worked on mini projects for my study table and home.

## DIY Projects

### Cool Pencil Stand

I made a cool pencil stand to organize my writing tools and add a unique touch to my study area. This custom-made stand serves a practical purpose and reflects my style using 3D Printing.

    <img width="32%" alt="Cool Pencil Stand" src="assets/Holder Picture">

</div>


### Custom Keychain

For my new home keys, I created a custom keychain. This personalized accessory helps me easily identify my house keys and adds a bit of flair to my everyday items using 3D Printing.

    <img width="32%" alt="Custom Keychain" src="assets/keychain.jpeg">
</div>


### Cal Logo for My Table

I made a Cal Logo for my table to show my connection to my new academic community. This decorative piece proudly displays my affiliation with the University of California, Berkeley, and adds a touch of school spirit to my study space using Laser Cutting.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; flex-wrap: wrap;">

    <img width="32%" alt="Cal Logo for My Table" src="assets/Cal.jpeg">

</div>

## Impact

These DIY projects have helped me transform my new living space into a more personalized environment. By adding these custom touches, I've begun to make my new Berkeley home feel more like my own.

In the future, I will try to merge technology tools to build something that can solve my problems in the quickest way possible.
