# Week 1: Personalizing My New Berkeley Home #
## Week of 09/05/2024

After moving to Berkeley, I have moved to a new home and wanted to make it more personal space, hence this week I worked on mini projects for my study table and home.

## DIY Projects

### Cool Pencil Stand

I made a cool pencil stand to organize my writing tools and add a unique touch to my study area. This custom-made stand not only serves a practical purpose but also reflects my personal style.

### Custom Keychain

For my new home keys, I created a custom keychain. This personalized accessory helps me easily identify my house keys and adds a bit of flair to my everyday items.

### Cal Logo for My Table

To show my connection to my new academic community, I made a Cal Logo for my table. This decorative piece proudly displays my affiliation with the University of California, Berkeley, and adds a touch of school spirit to my study space.
